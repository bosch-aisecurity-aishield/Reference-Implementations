    "1. **Initialize AIShield:** Ensure that AIShield is properly installed and its dependencies are set up. Also, initialize AIShield to prepare for the analysis.\n",

    "2. **Model Registration:** Register the specific task pair (e.g. image_classification) and analysis type (e.g. Extraction / MEA) to perform the vulnerability analysis accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Upload Artifacts:** Upload the necessary artifacts that have been prepared previously in STEP 4 for analysis. These may include datasets, trained models, or any relevant files.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Analysis:** Trigger the model analysis API to initiate the vulnerability analysis assessment. AIShield will perform the analysis using the uploaded artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Monitor Analysis Status:** Keep track of the analysis progress and patiently wait for AIShield to generate the vulnerability assessment results. This may take some time depending on the complexity of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Download Reports & Artifacts:** Once the analysis is complete, access and download the vulnerability analysis reports and any additional artifacts generated by AIShield. Analyze these reports to gain insights into potential vulnerabilities in your system or application.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following instructions, you can effectively call and integrate AIShield for Vulnerability Analysis."

By revisiting the training process and incorporating the insights gained from the vulnerability analysis, the model can be improved to better handle potential threats and mitigate vulnerabilities.\n",

This threat-informed defense model can be deployed alongside the original model to provide an additional layer of protection and enhance the overall security posture. By leveraging the insights gained from the vulnerability analysis, the defense model offers targeted defenses against potential threats."
